  <p>For this assignment, I decided to collect information on population statistics
    from the countries/empires/regions of each of our Authors from last quarter
    and compile a graph of the data. Visualizing the data in this way is helpful
    for observing large-scale trends in population growth in different regions and
    for analysis of how a country's population growth rate may have affected the
    social theory from that place.</p>

    <p>Clicking on the label for a country in the graph below hides the graph for
       that country. This is useful for shifting the focus of the graph away from
     large countries that disrupt the scale of the graph</p>

  <h1>Data Collection</h1>
  <p>Data was collected from a variety of sources on the internet, differing mostly
    based on the timespan I was searching for data in. For more recent timespans,
    I found the United Nations' database to be very useful. It contains detailed
    population estiamtes for all member nations for every years since 1950.</p>
    <p>As you search farther back in time, the search becomes more difficult.
      Until recently, most parts of the world didn't practice formal censuses so
      solid quantitative records are sparse. The best substitute I found were
      estimates made by historians, published in research journals or history
      books. This is largely the evidence I used when constructing this graph.</p>
