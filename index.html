  <p>For this assignment, I decided to collect information on population statistics
    from the countries/empires/regions of each of our Authors from last quarter
    and compile a graph of the data. Visualizing the data in this way is helpful
    for observing large-scale trends in population growth in different regions and
    for analysis of how a country's population growth rate may have affected the
    social theory from that place.</p>

  <p>Clicking on the label for a country in the graph below hides the graph for
    that country. This is useful for shifting the focus of the graph away from
    large countries that disrupt the scale of the graph. I have hidden some of
     these countries automatically, you can uncheck them to see their graphs.</p>

  <h1>Data Collection</h1>
  <p>Data was collected from a variety of sources on the internet, differing mostly
    based on the timespan I was searching for data in. For more recent timespans,
    I found the United Nations' database to be very useful. It contains detailed
    population estiamtes for all member nations for every years since 1950. Some
    countries also offered their own historical population data on their official
    websites.</p>
  <p>As you search farther back in time, the search becomes more difficult.
    Until recently, most parts of the world didn't practice formal censuses so
    solid quantitative records are sparse. The best substitute I found were
    estimates made by historians, published in research journals or history
    books. This is largely the evidence I used when constructing this graph.</p>

  <h1>Analysis</h1>
  <h2>Global Trends</h2>
  <p>Quantitative Analysis is difficult with such limited amounts of data but there
    are a few interesting trends that are immediately apparent. The first is the
    global prevelance of the increase in population growth rate in the 19th and
    20th century.This shift is correlated nicely with the industrial revolution
    because of the improvents to medical technology and food production that
    increased birth rates and decreased death rates around this time.</p>
  <h2>Individual Trends</h2>
  <p>One thing that I found particualarly interesting was the fact that the graph
    of England's population was not monotonously increasing, it drops pretty heavily
    in the late 1300's and doesn't fully rebound for a few hundred years. This is
    especially interesting in the context of McNeill's Plagues and people because
    the drop here is obviously caused by the population-devestating plague outbreaks
    that occurred all over Europe during this time. I was not able to collect data
    on the other European countries in the survey for this time period so I cannot easily
    compare the trend in England to it's neighbors.</p>
  <p>Another outstanding graph that I think is important to address is that of the
     Ottoman Empire. I selected the Ottoman Empire becuase when Ibn Khaldun wrote
      Muqaddimah in 1377 in the North Africa, he would've been within the Ottoman
      Empire. I could not find data on the Empire's population during Khaldun's
      lifetime but I was able to find some general population statistics from later
      in the Empire's lifespan. In fact, in the late 1830's, the Ottoman Empire
      also began taking censuses. The most important thing to note here however, is that
      the data on empire's population earlier is mostly estimated, and seems to rise
      and fall greatly over short periods of time. I believe that these fluctuations
      are not necessarily the product of population size loss, but the fluctuations
      in the geographic area that the empire included.
